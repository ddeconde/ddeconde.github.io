My name is David DeConde and like many with [STEM field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) educations I have lately been working as a [data scientist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science).

Before taking the [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) data science course and getting into applied work, I got my PhD in mathematics from [UCSC](http://www.math.ucsc.edu) where I studied asymptotically [hyperbolic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_manifold) spaces. Prior to that I studied biology at [Stanford University](https://biology.stanford.edu) and worked as a life science industry analyst at [Silicon Valley Bank](http://www.svb.com/lifescience/). More details can be found in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddeconde).
